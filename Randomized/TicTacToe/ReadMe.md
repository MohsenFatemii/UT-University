**Exercise 1.26:** 

Tic-tac-toe always ends up in a tie if players play optimally. Instead, we may consider random variations of tic-tac-toe.

(a) First variation: Each of the nine squares is labeled either X or 0 according to an independent and uniform coin flip. If only one of the players has one (or more) winning tic-tac-toe combinations, that player wins. Otherwise. the game is a tie. Determine the probability that X wins. (You may want to use a computer program to help run through the configurations.)

(b) Second variation: X and 0 take turns, with the X player going first. On the X player's turn, an X is placed on a square chosen independently and uniformly at random from the squares that are still vacant; 0 plays similarly. The first player to have a winning tic-tac-toe combination wins the game. and a tie occurs if neither player achieves a winning combination. Find the probability that each player wins. (Again, you may want to write a program to help you.)

the solution has written in `Java`
