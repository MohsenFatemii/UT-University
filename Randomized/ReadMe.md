**Exercise 1.26:**

Tic-tac-toe always ends up in a tie if players play optimally. Instead,
we may consider random variations of tic-tac-toe.

(a) First variation: Each of the nine squares is labeled either X or 0 according to an
independent and uniform coin flip. If only one of the players has one (or more)
winning tic-tac-toe combinations, that player wins. Otherwise. the game is a tie.
Determine the probability that X wins. (You may want to use a computer program
to help run through the configurations.)

(b) Second variation: X and 0 take turns, with the X player going first. On the X
player's turn, an X is placed on a square chosen independently and uniformly at
random from the squares that are still vacant; 0 plays similarly. The first player
to have a winning tic-tac-toe combination wins the game. and a tie occurs if neither
player achieves a winning combination. Find the probability that each player
wins. (Again, you may want to write a program to help you.)
